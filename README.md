# RCA-training

Today (12/9/19) we: 
Refreshed the RCA script. Now works with exports in EEGSsn folder. Need to point directly to the text export folder.
Discussed possibilities/difficulties of comparing components across conditions
Big question. Need more input from team.
Edited ellipsePlot.m function to work with our data
Was expecting sweep function (logarithmic) so most of the editing came from making the bin_vals work with non-step bins
Created more basic plot for ellipses within the main RCA script
Created code for flipping and reordering topographies
